C3D Model for Keras + TensorFlow
================================
Modified from C3D-keras

The scripts here accompany [`C3D Model for Keras`](https://gist.github.com/albertomontesg/d8b21a179c1e6cca0480ebdf292c34d2) gist, but specifically for Keras + TensorFlow (not Theano-backend).

Steps to reproduce results:

1. Download pretrained model: `bash models/get_weights_and_mean.sh`
2. Download sport1mil labels: `bash sports1m/get_labels.sh`
3. Download facebook/C3D `caffe.proto` file for conversion from caffe to Keras: `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/facebook/C3D/master/src/caffe/proto/caffe.proto`
4. Get protobuf that supports large enough `kDefaultTotalBytesLimit` as instructed in the [original gist](https://gist.github.com/albertomontesg/d8b21a179c1e6cca0480ebdf292c34d2). Version 3.0 or later should support this.
5. Compile the caffe.proto file for python: `protoc --python_out=. caffe.proto`
6. Convert the pre-trained model from Caffe format to Keras: `python convert_caffe_model.py`
7. Download test video: `bash download_test_video.sh`
8. Run test: `python test_model.py`

Issues
======
- Activation outputs begin to differ from `conv4a` layer for Theano and TensorFlow.
- Theano results are correct, but TF results are off (from `conv4a` to the final layer).
